During the next few weeks we will proceed to update all the OpenStack services (Cloud), taking advantage of the holiday period of many of you. The services will be updated little by little to more modern versions. They include compute, network, block storage (volumes) and portal access.

Update (08-11-2022): Some services are successfully updated. They are being monitored for future problems (Identity Service as the most dependent service). The rest of the services of the list are currently failing (Dashboard) or not updated yet (compute and network).
