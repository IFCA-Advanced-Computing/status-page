During the next few weeks we will proceed to update all the OpenStack services (Cloud), taking advantage of the holiday period of many of you. The services will be updated little by little to more modern versions. They include compute, network, block storage (volumes) and portal access.

Update (08-11-2022): Some services are successfully updated. They are being monitored for future problems (Identity Service as the most dependent service). The rest of the services of the list are currently failing (Dashboard) or not updated yet (compute and network).

Update (19-08-2022): update tasks performed. The system will be monitored for a few days

Update (01-09-2022): All services are updated except compute. We will proceed with the last update.
